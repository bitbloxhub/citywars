when you run out of cards, shuffle your discard into your deck

each player starts of with 6 cards

every turn starts with a card draw, and then playing cards

there are 2 types of cards:
* **action cards**, which have an immediate effect, and
* **object cards**, which are put into the object zone and stay there until destroyed (when destroyed, they go into the discard pile)

each player starts off with 500 gold

if a player gets to 0 gold, they lose

there are **resources**, which are per-city (for example, wheat. your city has 5 wheat), and  
**tokens** which are per-object
